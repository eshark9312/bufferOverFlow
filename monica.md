**Question : give me the full available list of functions in c/c++ with buffer overflow vulnerabiliity detected and the examples for each of them.**

Here is a list of commonly used functions in C/C++ that are known to have buffer overflow vulnerabilities, along with examples and ways to prevent buffer overflows:

1. `strcpy()`

Example:

```c
char src[10] = "Hello";
char dest[5];
strcpy(dest, src);
```

This code copies the contents of `src` into `dest`, which is only 5 bytes long. This can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the length of the source string (plus one for the null terminator).

2. `strcat()`

Example:

```c
char dest[10] = "Hello";
char src[5] = "World";
strcat(dest, src);
```

This code concatenates `src` onto the end of `dest`, which is only 10 bytes long. This can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `strncat()` instead of `strcat()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the combined length of the source strings (plus one for the null terminator).

3. `sprintf()`

Example:

```c
char buffer[10];
int value = 12345;
sprintf(buffer, "%d", value);
```

This code formats an integer value as a string and stores it in `buffer`, which is only 10 bytes long. If the integer value is too large, this can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `snprintf()` instead of `sprintf()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the maximum number of characters that can be written to the buffer (including the null terminator).

4. `gets()`

Example:

```c
char buffer[10];
gets(buffer);
```

This code reads a line of input from the user and stores it in `buffer`, which is only 10 bytes long. If the user enters a string that is too long, this can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `fgets()` or `getline()` instead of `gets()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the maximum number of characters that can be read from the input (including the null terminator).

5. `scanf()`

Example:

```c
int value;
scanf("%d", &value);
```

This code reads an integer value from the user and stores it in `value`. If the user enters a value that is too large, this can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `%n` to limit the number of characters that can be read from the input, like this:

```c
int value;
char buffer[10];
if (scanf("%9d%n", &value, &n) == 1 && buffer[n] == '\n') {
    // Input was valid
}
```

6. `fscanf()`

Example:

```c
int value;
FILE *fp = fopen("input.txt", "r");
fscanf(fp, "%d", &value);
fclose(fp);
```

This code reads an integer value from a file and stores it in `value`. If the value in the file is too large, this can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `%n` to limit the number of characters that can be read from the input, like this:

```c
int value;
char buffer[10];
if (fscanf(fp, "%9d%n", &value, &n) == 1 && buffer[n] == '\n') {
    // Input was valid
}
```

7. `gets_s()`

Example:

```c
char buffer[10];
gets_s(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
```

This code reads a line of input from the user and stores it in `buffer`, which is only 10 bytes long. If the user enters a string that is too long, this can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Use `fgets()` or `getline()` instead of `gets_s()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the maximum number of characters that can be read from the input (including the null terminator).

8. `strncpy()` (if not used correctly)

Example:

```c
char src[10] = "Hello";
char dest[5];
strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));
```

This code copies the contents of `src` into `dest`, but because it uses `sizeof(dest)` instead of `sizeof(src)`, it only copies 5 bytes. This can cause a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Prevention:

Always use `sizeof(src)` as the third argument to `strncpy()`, and ensure that the size of the destination buffer is at least as large as the length of the source string (plus one for the null terminator).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
